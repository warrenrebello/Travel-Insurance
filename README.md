# Travel-Insurance
This project entails creating a model that can predict for whether a customer can claim for Travel Insurance or not

#### Problem Statement
##### Insurance companies take risks over customers. Risk management is a very important aspect of the insurance industry. Insurers consider every quantifiable factor to develop profiles of high and low insurance risks. Insurers collect vast amounts of information about policyholders and analyse the data. As a Data scientist in an insurance company, you need to analyse the available data and predict whether to approve the insurance or not.
